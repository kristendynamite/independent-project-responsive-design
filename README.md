# _Basic Gallery - Responsive Design_

#### Week 2 Project - CSS

#### By **Rose Sponseller and Kristen McKee, May 31, 2017**

## Description

This project incorporates a responsive design pattern for a Basic Gallery that will adjust depending on three different breakpoints.

This website layout follows a popular design pattern: simple rectangles arranged evenly on a solid background. This format is super easy to reflow as the viewport changes. You simply have to reduce the number of columns a few times.
